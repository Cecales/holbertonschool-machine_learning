## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

* What is a vector?
* What is a matrix?
* What is a transpose?
* What is the shape of a matrix?
* What is an axis?
* What is a slice?
* How do you slice a vector/matrix?
* What are element-wise operations?
* How do you concatenate vectors/matrices?
* What is the dot product?
* What is matrix multiplication?
* What is Numpy?
* What is parallelization and why is it important?
* What is broadcasting?

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8)
* Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.19.2)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should follow pycodestyle (version 2.6)
* All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
* Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
