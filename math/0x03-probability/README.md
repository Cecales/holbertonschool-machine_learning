## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

* What is probability?
* Basic probability notation
* What is independence? What is disjoint?
* What is a union? intersection?
* What are the general addition and multiplication rules?
* What is a probability distribution?
* What is a probability distribution function? probability mass function?
* What is a cumulative distribution function?
* What is a percentile?
* What is mean, standard deviation, and variance?
* Common probability distributions

## Requirements

### General

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.6)
* All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
* Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Mathematical Approximations

For the following tasks, you will have to use various irrational numbers and functions. Since you are not able to import any libraries, please use the following approximations:

* π = 3.1415926536
* e = 2.7182818285
